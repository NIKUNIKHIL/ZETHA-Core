## 🛰️ The Vision
Shopping is broken. The web is flooded with bot-written reviews and dropshipping junk. **ZETHA** is a community-driven ecosystem where **Scouts** (certified curators) find and vet the world's best items for **Seekers** (buyers who value taste).

ZETHA replaces "Search" with **Trust**.

## 🔮 The Vibe-Check (Reputation Engine)
We don't do 5-star ratings. We use the **Vibe-Check**—a transparent, on-chain reputation score.
* **Proof of Find:** +10 points for unique offline/local discoveries.
* **Community Vouch:** +5 points when a Tier 3 Scout validates your find.
* **The Fade:** Reputation drops for "Dead Links," spam, or ghosting seekers.

## 🏗️ The Philosophy (Open Core)
We believe the "Trust Layer" of the internet should be transparent. We are open-sourcing the ZETHA interface so you can:
1. **Audit the Math:** See exactly how Vibe-Checks are calculated.
2. **Build Skins:** Create niche-specific interfaces (Vintage, Tech, Bio-hacking).
3. **Protect Privacy:** While the UI is open, all personal data stays encrypted and private.

## 🛠️ The Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** Flutter / Dart (iOS, Android, Web)
- **Backend:** Supabase (PostgreSQL + Auth)
- **Payments:** Stripe Connect (Escrow Protection)
- **AI Engine:** OpenAI (Automated vetting & tagging)

## 🏆 The Founding 100
We are hand-picking the first **100 Founding Scouts** to set the tone of the platform.
- **Perk:** 0% Platform Fees for life.
- **Perk:** Genesis "Founders" Badge on profile.
- **Apply Here:** [Link to Scout Form]

## 🏗️ Want to Contribute?
We are looking for:
* **UI/UX Wizards:** Help us build the most aesthetic marketplace on earth.
* **AI Engineers:** Help us refine the "Scout-Bot" for fake-listing detection.
* **Vibe-Architects:** Help us evolve the reputation math.
